# About Project

NLP stands for Natural Language Processing and is a driven force of many models that help business every day with building recommendation systems or translating large amounts of text. Thanks to NLP we can extract what people feel, think and how they interact with the data. Natural language is quite messy, and not that easy to analyse. Kids take years to understand the world of words around us and developing proficient solutions is a hard task for many reasons like language evolution or adaptation. In this repository I'm going to go trough concepts behind NLP and run a sample test on financial news headlines.
